# Dwarf Land

AI-powered civilization simulator. Autonomous dwarves make decisions using tiered AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT). Built on Cloudflare Workers.

**Live:** [dwarf.land](https://dwarf.land)

## Features

### World
- 2000x1000 emoji tile world map with 125 real-world cities across all continents
- 7 continents with biome-specific terrain (tundra, desert, jungle, mountains, ocean)
- Terrain speed system with Dijkstra pathfinding (mountains = slow, roads = fast, spatial indexing for O(1) neighbor lookups)
- Auto-generated roads between cities using A* (land-only, no ocean crossing)
- Railroads: dwarves upgrade roads for ultra-fast travel (3 iron + 2 wood per tile)
- **Persistent terrain**: all tile changes (builds, farms, roads, mines, designations) saved as deltas and restored on reload
- **Loop Hero rendering**: adjacent same-type terrain tiles grouped into larger squares with scaled emojis (greedy cover, world-aligned for scroll stability)
- **Graves** (🪦): dwarves leave a tombstone on the map where they died
- Per-city resources and culturally-named populations
- Cities auto-expand when population and resources allow (beds, stockpiles, tables)

### Dwarves
- Up to 300 autonomous dwarves with D&D stats (STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA)
- Cultural names from 83 real civilizations
- AI-generated backstories and personality traits
- Soul attributes: faith, morality, ambition
- Age system with stat modifiers (young +DEX, elder +WIS, ancient death chance)
- Carry system: dwarves haul resources back to stockpiles based on STR
- Food sharing: generous dwarves share with hungry neighbors (based on morality + CHA)
- Starvation mechanics: 30-day hunger → immobility → 10-day rescue window → death
- Rescue AI: dwarves carrying food path toward starving city-mates

### Crafting (Infinite Craft)
- Combine any two items to create new ones (Water + Fire = Steam)
- 296 base items seeded from InfiniteCraftWiki (depth 1-6)
- Unknown combos resolved via AI (Gemini Flash Lite) and cached forever
- Per-dwarf inventory (max 6 craft items)
- Dwarves auto-craft at workshops when idle with 2+ items
- Terrain yields craft ingredients (mining = Earth/Stone, fishing = Water, etc.)

### Trading
- Dwarves from different cities trade when they meet on the same tile
- INT advantage: smarter dwarves get 2:1 deals, equal INT = 1:1 swap (inventory cap enforced)
- Enemy dwarves refuse to trade (relationship system)
- Detailed trade logs show exactly what was exchanged
- 30% trigger chance per meeting to prevent spam

### Ships & Sea Travel
- Ships built at coastal cities (10 wood + 3 cloth + 2 iron)
- 1 captain per ship — sails across ocean to other coastal cities
- Captain sleeps and eats aboard; ship auto-fishes from fish spots
- Cargo system: resources transfer to destination city on arrival
- Ambitious dwarves spontaneously embark on voyages
- Click ships on map to inspect cargo, captain, destination

### UI
- Click inspector for dwarves (stats, inventory, carry, events), cities (ideology), terrain, ships
- **Live inspector**: open panels auto-refresh every 30 ticks — watch stats change in real time
- Follow/lock camera on a specific dwarf with pulsing ring indicator
- City switcher dropdown in top HUD — click city name to jump to any of 125 cities
- City ideology labels computed from aggregate personality (Militant, Spiritual, Mercantile, etc.)
- Contextual Mine/Build/Farm/Road designation buttons with drag-to-designate
- Speed slider (⏸ → 1x → 2x → 5x) for simulation speed control
- Event log with season emoji timestamps (🌱☀️🍂❄️) and rarity filter with consecutive entry collapsing (×N); all events with locations are clickable (pans camera)
- **Temperature tinting**: HUD and status bar shift warm amber → cool blue based on camera latitude and season
- **Year resolutions banner**: each new year shows per-city goals (farming, expansion, crafting) based on population stats
- Footer shows full season + year (e.g. "Autumn, Year 16")
- Clickable minimap: click/tap to jump camera to any location on desktop and mobile
- Splash screen for new visitors + in-game mechanics guide
- Full mobile support: touch pan, pinch-to-zoom (0.75x–3.0x), tap-to-inspect
- Responsive layout: bottom sheet inspector, collapsible event log, thumb-zone toolbar
- iOS safe area support, 44px touch targets, designation mode with cancel button

### Performance
- BFS pathfinding capped at 2000 steps (covers ~44x44 area)
- Tick stagger: only 1/4 of dwarves compute AI per tick
- Spatial index (8-tile grid buckets) for O(1) neighbor lookups in sharing/trading
- Throttled food search with wander cooldown to prevent BFS spam
- Frame tick cap of 3 prevents lag death spiral
- Tile buffer patching: individual tile changes painted as 1x1 without full re-render (square cover recalculation only on camera move)
- Cached measureText for city labels, hoisted Set constants
- Batch backstory endpoint: 10 dwarves per request, single rate limit check
- Backstory request queue drains every 15s in batches (not individual calls)

### AI
- 4-tier model routing (simple/medium/complex/premium) via OpenRouter
- Fire-and-forget AI calls: game never blocks on responses
- Intent cache: AI decides, cache stores intent, dwarf executes when idle
- Budget hard caps prevent runaway spending ($8.50/hr total)
- In-memory rate limiting per tier

## Sponsorship

Pay to upgrade a dwarf's AI reasoning tier via Polar.sh. Sponsored dwarves get a star badge and make smarter decisions.
