# Dwarf Land

AI-powered civilization simulator. Autonomous dwarves make decisions using tiered AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT). Built on Cloudflare Workers.

**Live:** [dwarf.land](https://dwarf.land)

## Features

### World
- 500x250 emoji tile world map with 48 real-world cities across all continents
- 7 continents with biome-specific terrain (tundra, desert, jungle, mountains, ocean)
- Terrain speed system with Dijkstra pathfinding (mountains = slow, roads = fast)
- Auto-generated roads between cities using A* (land-only, no ocean crossing)
- Railroads: dwarves upgrade roads for ultra-fast travel (3 iron + 2 wood per tile)
- Per-city resources and culturally-named populations
- Cities auto-expand when population and resources allow (beds, stockpiles, tables)

### Dwarves
- 80-140 autonomous dwarves with D&D stats (STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA)
- Cultural names from 47 real civilizations
- AI-generated backstories and personality traits
- Soul attributes: faith, morality, ambition
- Age system with stat modifiers (young +DEX, elder +WIS, ancient death chance)
- Carry system: dwarves haul resources back to stockpiles based on STR
- Food sharing: generous dwarves share with hungry neighbors (based on morality + CHA)

### Crafting (Infinite Craft)
- Combine any two items to create new ones (Water + Fire = Steam)
- 296 base items seeded from InfiniteCraftWiki (depth 1-6)
- Unknown combos resolved via AI (Gemini Flash Lite) and cached forever
- Per-dwarf inventory (max 6 craft items)
- Dwarves auto-craft at workshops when idle with 2+ items
- Terrain yields craft ingredients (mining = Earth/Stone, fishing = Water, etc.)

### Trading
- Dwarves from different cities trade when they meet on the same tile
- INT advantage: smarter dwarves get 2:1 deals, equal INT = 1:1 swap
- Enemy dwarves refuse to trade (relationship system)
- Detailed trade logs show exactly what was exchanged
- 30% trigger chance per meeting to prevent spam

### Ships & Sea Travel
- Ships built at coastal cities (10 wood + 3 cloth + 2 iron)
- 1 captain per ship — sails across ocean to other coastal cities
- Captain sleeps and eats aboard; ship auto-fishes from fish spots
- Cargo system: resources transfer to destination city on arrival
- Ambitious dwarves spontaneously embark on voyages
- Click ships on map to inspect cargo, captain, destination

### UI
- Click inspector for dwarves (stats, inventory, carry, events), cities (ideology), terrain, ships
- Follow/lock camera on a specific dwarf with pulsing ring indicator
- City switcher dropdown in top HUD — click city name to jump to any of 48 cities
- City ideology labels computed from aggregate personality (Militant, Spiritual, Mercantile, etc.)
- Contextual Mine/Build/Farm/Road actions in dwarf inspector
- Splash screen for new visitors + in-game mechanics guide

### AI
- 4-tier model routing (simple/medium/complex/premium) via OpenRouter
- Fire-and-forget AI calls: game never blocks on responses
- Intent cache: AI decides, cache stores intent, dwarf executes when idle
- Budget hard caps prevent runaway spending ($8.50/hr total)
- In-memory rate limiting per tier

## Sponsorship

Pay to upgrade a dwarf's AI reasoning tier via Polar.sh. Sponsored dwarves get a star badge and make smarter decisions.

| Tier | Price | AI Upgrade | Calls |
|------|-------|------------|-------|
| Bronze | $1 | medium | 100 |
| Silver | $3 | complex | 75 |
| Gold | $10 | premium | 100 |

- **Tests:** Vitest (143 tests across 11 files)

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev              # local dev server
npm test                 # run 143 tests
npm run test:watch       # vitest watch mode
npm run db:migrate:local # apply D1 migrations locally
npm run db:migrate:remote # apply D1 migrations to production
npm run deploy           # deploy to Cloudflare Workers
```

### Seeding craft data

```bash
npx tsx scripts/import-craft-data.ts     # downloads + generates SQL
npm run db:migrate:local                  # apply locally
npm run db:migrate:remote                 # apply to production
```
