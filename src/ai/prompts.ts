AVAILABLE ACTIONS: ${actions}

Rules:
- If hunger < 30, pick "eat"
- If energy < 20, pick "sleep"
- Otherwise pick productive work: mine, farm, chop, build, craft, cook
- If home city has surplus food/wood and the dwarf is well-fed and rested, "travel" to another city for trade or exploration (uses cart/car/train/ship depending on connection)
- If nothing urgent, "wander" or "explore"
- Keep reasons under 80 chars
